WeChat makes communication much easier and faster. I enjoyed talking with my friends a lot by using WeChat. However, I think the service options for grouping are lacking. Sometimes, I was enrolled in a group without my own consent. Also, I found that I was not able to completely quit a group without other's notice. Sometimes, I cannot quit a group because I did not want other friends or colleagues to notice my quitting action. At the same time, I was struggling to stay in the group. I have tried to apply different exiting functions, which did not work. For example, When I turned on the message undisturbed mode and deleted the group record, the group still showed up if someone spoke. I wanna find an easy way to completely get rid of a group or at least a particular member in the group without everyone else's notice. Several friends of mine also have the similar concern. Can you please consider improving group exiting functions? Thank you!
I'm not gonna lie, I'm addicted to this app. This has every thing a messaging app needs and it's also cool that some third party apps can let you make GIF stickers. I just think that this could use a few features that would be really EVERY THING a messaging app need. For one thing, a read or seen receipts option. And also, I'm a little weird but I think we should get to see the time a message was recieved. My friends and I all also think there should be a thing that says someone is typing. And finally, I really just want to be able to caption a photo. It's awkward when I send a photo then quickly type a message, it sends and the photo is still at 80%.
